# Smart Meter Analytics Documentation

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict energy consumption using a machine learning model. Specifically, it uses data from Indian smart meters and applies a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict energy usage based on features like temperature and humidity. This code demonstrates data preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization of actual vs. predicted energy consumption.

## Prerequisites

The following libraries are required to run this code:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning model implementation and evaluation.

To install these libraries, you can use:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Indian smart meter data. Ensure the dataset is accessible, or modify the code with the correct path or URL if necessary.

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. **Importing Libraries**

```python
import pandas as pd  # For data manipulation and analysis
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # For data visualization
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  # To split data into training and testing sets
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor  # A machine learning model for prediction
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error  # To evaluate model performance
```

- **`pandas`**: Used for loading and managing the dataset.
- **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: Used for visualizing actual vs. predicted energy consumption.
- **`sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`**: Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- **`sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`**: The machine learning model used for prediction.
- **`sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error`**: Calculates the mean squared error to evaluate model accuracy.

### 2. **Loading the Dataset**

```python
data_india = pd.read_csv('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pythonafroz/electricity-smart-meter-data-from-india')  # Update with the correct URL if needed
print(data_india.head())  # Display first five rows to understand the structure
```

This loads the dataset from a CSV file and previews the first few rows for reference.

### 3. **Feature Selection and Target Variable**

```python
features_india = data_india[['temperature', 'humidity']]  # Modify based on actual columns
target_india = data_india['consumption']  # Energy consumption column
```

- **`features_india`**: Selects input features for the model (e.g., `temperature`, `humidity`).
- **`target_india`**: Defines the target variable, assumed to be energy consumption.

Modify these columns as needed based on your dataset structure.

### 4. **Data Splitting**

The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

```python
X_train_india, X_test_india, y_train_india, y_test_india = train_test_split(features_india, target_india, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

- **`train_test_split`**: Randomly splits the data, allowing the model to learn from the training data and test its performance on unseen data.

### 5. **Model Initialization and Training**

```python
model_india = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)  # Initializes the model
model_india.fit(X_train_india, y_train_india)  # Trains the model
```

- **`RandomForestRegressor`**: A robust model for regression tasks that creates multiple decision trees and averages their outputs.
  - **`n_estimators=100`**: Specifies the number of trees in the forest.
- **`.fit()`**: Trains the model on the training data.

### 6. **Prediction and Model Evaluation**

```python
y_pred_india = model_india.predict(X_test_india)  # Predicts on test data
mse_india = mean_squared_error(y_test_india, y_pred_india)  # Calculates Mean Squared Error
print(f'Mean Squared Error (India): {mse_india}')
```

- **`.predict()`**: Uses the trained model to predict energy consumption.
- **`mean_squared_error`**: Calculates the mean squared error to measure prediction accuracy. Lower values indicate better model performance.

### 7. **Visualization**

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(y_test_india.values, label='Actual Consumption (India)')
plt.plot(y_pred_india, label='Predicted Consumption (India)')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Actual vs Predicted Energy Consumption (India)')
plt.xlabel('Test Data Index')
plt.ylabel('Energy Consumption (kWh)')
plt.show()
```

A plot comparing actual vs. predicted energy consumption is generated to visually assess model performance.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Ensure the dataset is available and accessible.
   - Run the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
2. **Interpret the Output**:
   - Observe the printed mean squared error and the generated plot to evaluate model performance.

## Future Enhancements

- **Feature Engineering**: Experiment with additional features for improved prediction accuracy.
- **Model Tuning**: Use techniques like grid search or cross-validation to optimize model parameters.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Implement a time-series model for sequential data, as energy consumption patterns often follow a time-based trend.
